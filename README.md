General information: This is my answer to homework 4, using data from the North Temperate Lakes LTER 1981 Fish Lengths and Weights dataset. The analysis  aims to assess whether fish length may predict fish weight. 

Data/file overview:
.gitignores ensure that files not tracked by Git remain untracked 
.Rhistory: logs commands entered into console
The code folder holds the rendered word document including all of the code without warning or error messages as well the the quarto markdown with the actual code. 
The data folder has a folder holding the LTER data used in this study, including metadata documents and textfiles. Outside of that folder but within the data folder still is the csv file used in this study.
